# Lines Games V2 - STICKY WILDS

This is a copy of the 0_0_lines game with STICKY WILDS functionality added.

Wilds have multipliers in the freeGame and have the effect of multiplying a given line win by the addition multiplier of values attached to Wild symbols, 
only when the multiplier value is > 1.

Basegame:
Scatter Symbols appear on all reels, a minimum of 3 Scatters are needed to trigger the Freegame

FreeGame - STICKY WILDS:
A separate reelstrip is used for the freegame 
Wilds have larger multipliers (minimum of 2x) and appear on all reels
2 Scatters are needed to trigger extra spins, appearing only on reels 2,3,4

**NEW FEATURE: STICKY WILDS**
- Any wild that lands during free spins becomes "sticky" and stays in place for all remaining free spins
- Wilds accumulate throughout the free game, creating more and more winning opportunities
- Each sticky wild maintains its original multiplier value throughout the free game
- The X2 modifier symbol can double existing sticky wild multipliers
- Sticky wilds are cleared when the free game ends
- **BALANCED**: Wilds only pay on 5-of-a-kind (50x) to prevent overpowered wins
- **CONSERVATIVE PAYTABLE**: Reduced all payouts by ~60-70% to balance with sticky wilds
- **HIERARCHY MAINTAINED**: H symbols still pay 3-5x more than L symbols

Notes:
Wilds only pay on 5-Kind. If the paytable is chosen such that 3/4 Kind Wilds pay, the line
calculation will assign the highest base-win symbols as winning. For example if there is a 3-Kind
Wild is on the same line as a 5-Kind L4, the 3-Kind wild will be chosen, regardless of the multiplier
on the final Wild since the base payout 3W > 5L4
