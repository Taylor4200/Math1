Notes:
Wilds only pay on 5-Kind. If the paytable is chosen such that 3/4 Kind Wilds pay, the line
calculation will assign the highest base-win symbols as winning. For example if there is a 3-Kind
Wild is on the same line as a 5-Kind L4, the 3-Kind wild will be chosen, regardless of the multiplier
on the final Wild since the base payout 3W > 5L4
