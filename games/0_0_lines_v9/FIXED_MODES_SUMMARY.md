# Super Bonus & Bonus Booster - Issue Summary

## Problem
Both modes have broken RTPs due to the K symbol mechanics:
- K symbols drop 1-5 wilds with multipliers
- These wilds become STICKY in free games
- When free games are forced/frequent, this compounds exponentially

## Current Status
- **Super Bonus**: 294% RTP (should be 96%)
- **Bonus Booster**: 134,737% RTP (should be 96%)

## Root Cause
The sticky wild + wild drop mechanics were designed for RARE free game triggers (~7% hit rate in base game).
When you FORCE or BOOST free game rates, the mechanics become too powerful.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Disable K mechanics for these modes (CURRENT)
- Super Bonus: No sticky wilds, no wild drops
- Bonus Booster: Keep mechanics but they're still too powerful

### Option 2: Make them simple buy bonuses
- Super Bonus: Pay 500 to guarantee 4 scatters (12 spins)
- Bonus Booster: Pay 2 for 2x scatter rate (not guaranteed)
- Use SAME multiplier distributions as base/Bonus modes

### Option 3: Remove these modes entirely
- They're not working with the current game mechanics
- The K symbol feature is too volatile for buy bonuses

## Recommendation
These modes need to be redesigned from scratch with simpler mechanics, OR removed entirely.
The current K symbol sticky wild system is incompatible with forced/boosted free games.
