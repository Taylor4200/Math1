# Lines Games V9 - K SYMBOL WILD DROPS

This is a 5x5 lines game with K symbol mechanic that drops wilds with multipliers.

**BOARD:** 5x5 grid with 15 paylines

**K SYMBOL MECHANIC:**
- K symbols appear on reels naturally (replaced all W on reels with K)
- **K acts as a WILD symbol itself** - it substitutes for other symbols and pays on lines (5K = 50x)
- K also has a multiplier (2x-128x) like wilds
- Each K symbol is assigned a number (1-5) determining how many ADDITIONAL wilds it drops
- **W symbols DO NOT appear on reels** - they are ONLY created by K symbols dropping them
- When a K lands, it acts as wild in its position AND launches additional W symbols to OTHER random positions
- K symbols do NOT drop wilds on their own positions (they drop to OTHER positions)
- Dropped wilds (W) can have multipliers up to 128x initially
- **MULTIPLIER DOUBLING:** If a K drops a wild on a position where a wild already exists, it DOUBLES the multiplier
  - Example: 64x wild + new wild drop = 128x wild
  - This can cascade: 128x -> 256x -> 512x -> 1024x, etc.
- K is like a "launcher/slingshot" - it stays wild, but shoots out more wilds elsewhere

**FEATURE SPINS:**
- **Feature Spin (20x cost):** Guarantees 2 K symbols on the board
  - Each K drops 1-5 wilds randomly
  - Potential for 2-10 wilds dropped total
- **Super Feature Spin (750x cost):** Guarantees 5 K symbols on the board
  - Each K drops 1-5 wilds randomly
  - Potential for 5-25 wilds dropped total
  - Maximum multiplier stacking opportunity

**BASEGAME:**
- K symbols appear naturally with varying frequency
- Scatter symbols (3+ needed) trigger free spins

**FREEGAME - STICKY WILDS:**
- All wilds dropped by K symbols become "sticky" and remain for all remaining free spins
- Wilds accumulate throughout the free game
- New K symbols can drop wilds on existing sticky wilds, doubling their multipliers
- Creates exponential multiplier growth potential
- Sticky wilds cleared when free game ends

**MULTIPLIER SYSTEM:**
- Initial wild multipliers: 2x, 3x, 5x, 10x, 20x, 50x, 100x, 128x
- Doubling stacks multiplicatively (not additively)
- Theoretical max unlimited through doubling mechanic

Notes:
Wilds only pay on 5-of-a-kind (50x). The K symbol mechanic creates high variance through:
1. Random drop positions (can hit same positions)
2. Multiplier doubling on overlaps
3. Sticky wilds in free games accumulating K drops
