# Lines Games V9 - STICKY WILDS WITH GLOBAL MULTIPLIER

This is version 9 of the 0_0_lines game with STICKY WILDS and GLOBAL MULTIPLIER functionality.

Wilds have multipliers and become sticky during free games. The sum of all sticky wild multipliers creates a global multiplier that applies to all wins.

Basegame:
Scatter Symbols appear on all reels, a minimum of 3 Scatters are needed to trigger the Freegame

FreeGame - STICKY WILDS WITH GLOBAL MULTIPLIER:
A separate reelstrip is used for the freegame 
Wilds have larger multipliers (minimum of 2x) and appear on all reels
Scatters trigger extra spins (3 scatters = 10 spins, 4 scatters = 12 spins)

**FEATURE: STICKY WILDS WITH GLOBAL MULTIPLIER**
- Any wild that lands during free spins becomes "sticky" and stays in place for all remaining free spins
- Wilds accumulate throughout the free game, creating more and more winning opportunities
- Each sticky wild maintains its original multiplier value throughout the free game
- The sum of ALL sticky wild multipliers creates a global multiplier
- The global multiplier applies to all line wins, making them worth more as more wilds accumulate
- Example: 
  * Spin 1: 2 wilds land (5x + 10x) = 15x global multiplier
  * Spin 2: 1 more wild lands (20x) = (5 + 10 + 20) = 35x global multiplier
  * Spin 3: 2 more wilds land (3x + 5x) = (5 + 10 + 20 + 3 + 5) = 43x global multiplier
- Sticky wilds are cleared when the free game ends

Notes:
Wilds only pay on 5-Kind. If the paytable is chosen such that 3/4 Kind Wilds pay, the line
calculation will assign the highest base-win symbols as winning. For example if there is a 3-Kind
Wild is on the same line as a 5-Kind L4, the 3-Kind wild will be chosen, regardless of the multiplier
on the final Wild since the base payout 3W > 5L4
